## Introduction

**COSÌ** (Catalogo Online dei Segnali discorsivi dell'Italiano) is a project under elaboration at University of Salerno, which aims to build an open online catalog of Italian discourse markers. It will provide a comprehensive, corpus-based resource for the analysis, annotation, and exploration of discourse markers (DMs) in contemporary spoken Italian.

## Background and Motivation

To our knowledge, the only existing online resource entirely devoted to DMs is the _Diccionario de Partículas Discursivas del Español_ (DPDE; Briz et al. 2008). While excellent, its static design presents certain limitations that COSÌ aims to overcome:

- No direct link to the corpus for spoken examples; speaker metadata is inaccessible.
- Register information is presented assertively, rather than allowing user-driven context exploration.
- Prosodic features are only accessible via limited examples, sometimes inferred from written language.
- No dynamic, corpus-driven exploration or reproducible annotation process.

COSÌ is grounded in the philosophy of **linked data**, focusing on interoperability, sustainability, and reusability. It is designed to interact with the _Kiparla_ corpus of spoken Italian.

## Annotation Initiatives

The main prior annotation model for DMs is **MDMA** (Bolly et al., 2015). It:

- Covers all stages of DM analysis—from identification to annotation.
- Uses corpus-based, objective, and replicable criteria.
- Distinguishes DM and non-DM uses of the same lexical items.
- Relies on syntactic, semantic, and contextual criteria.
- Maximizes objectivity and inter-annotator agreement.

COSÌ builds on MDMA’s strengths, especially in operationalizing objective criteria, and extends annotation to:

- Clusters of DMs, macro- and micro-functions.
- Systematic connection with a large spoken corpus for sociolinguistic profiling and cluster analysis.

### General Architecture

COSÌ consists of **two parts**:

## Project Structure

- **Website** *(to be developed)*
    - Planned: A user interface to explore each DM’s frequency, functions, and usage profiles.

- **Open Repository**
    - Includes: Data files, annotation guidelines, substitution test results, and occurrence contexts.


For each DM, you will find:

- Annotated occurrences from Kiparla (contextualized with X words before/after).
- Substitution tests for transparent and verifiable DM annotation.
- Functional annotation files.

---

### Selecting DMs

DM selection combined:

- **Frequency**: Frequency lists from KIParla (Mauri et al. 2019) and VoLIP (Voghera et al. 2014).
- **Functional Salience and Theoretical Relevance**: Tokens flagged as potential DMs from out-of-context frequency lists.

Occurrences are extracted randomly via NoSketchEngine, with full KIParla metadata for traceability and interoperability.

---

### Annotation Schema Design

Functional annotation draws on literature (Bazzanella 2011, cfr. Sansò 2020), adapted for transparency for annotators and coverage. A **medium level of granularity** balances descriptive depth with feasibility.
