Description

This folder contains resources and data for the annotation and analysis of discourse markers (DMs) in the KIParla corpus.
Folder Structure and Contents

    DiscourseMarkers:
    A list (to be cleaned for minor issues such as spelling) of the 236 discourse markers considered “autonomous”—that is, forms made up of a single element or of multiple elements that are not themselves DMs. This set includes 174 single forms, 55 bigrams, and 7 trigrams.
    Each entry is annotated with its frequency and includes a list of clusters (“complex” DMs) in which it appears.

    KIParla_FrequencyList_moreThan100occurrences:
    List of the 1,516 forms in the KIParla corpus that occur more than 100 times, including 174 forms that have been annotated as DMs.

    unigrams:
    List of the 174 single-word forms considered as DMs.

    KIParla_Bigrams_moreThan100occurrences:
    List of the 1,552 bigrams in KIParla with a frequency greater than 100, of which 186 have been annotated as DMs.

    bigrams:
    List of the 186 bigrams considered as DMs.

    KIParla_Trigrams_moreThan100occurrences:
    List of the 157 trigrams in KIParla with a frequency greater than 100, of which 29 have been annotated as DMs.

    trigrams:
    List of the 29 trigrams considered as DMs.

Notes

    All frequency information refers to occurrences in the KIParla corpus.

    Annotation files indicate which forms have been identified as discourse markers and, where relevant, provide details on clusters or complex DMs.

    Please refer to the main annotation guidelines for instructions on how to use and update these files.
